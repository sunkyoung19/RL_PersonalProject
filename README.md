## ðŸŽ´ Old Maid (Joker) Game â€“ Reinforcement Learning Simulation
This project implements an Old Maid (Joker) card game environment and trains agents using Q-learning and Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms to learn optimal card-drawing strategies.

### Game Overview

Game Rules:

1. One Joker card is removed â†’ 53 cards are shuffled and distributed to players.
2. Players discard pairs (same rank).
3. On each turn, the agent decides whether to draw a card from the next player or skip the turn.
4. The player who ends up with the Old Maid loses.
